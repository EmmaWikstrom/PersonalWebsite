# PersonalWebsite
Frontend course Fundamentals, first assignment - Build your personal Website

## Reflections: 

### What did you learn during this project?

Basics of HTML and CSS, how to start a new project, create a website, to use github and the terminal. New ways of working with AI, both good and bad. 

I learned new ways of structuring my workflow and how to adapt it to make it align with the flow of the course and lectures. I value that I learned what changes I need to make for better ways of learning in the future.

I also learned how I can have AI, in my case chatGPT, as a substitute teacher. My main goal was to understand my code, I asked it to explain like a teacher which was very helpful both when I didn't know what to look for and when I had found something I didn't understand. 

### What was your biggest challenge, and how did you approach it?

I think I was my biggest challenge, I hade to work with patience while handling stress and frustration. It is a balance to know when to continue and when to let things go, let them be good enough to be able to move on with the project.

In general I struggled more with CSS than HTML, but that also made it more fulfilling when things actually turned out to do what I wanted them to do, e.g responsivity.

### What are you most proud of in your site?

That it works, has responsivity and that I feel it is a good representation of me,not only in words but also in design with colors and fonts.
I didn't jump too far with AI and make my site too advanced for me to understand it. It is cute and basic and I am proud that I am okay with that.
