            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>Hi! Iâ€™m Emma, a Frontend Developer student at Hyper Island in Stockholm. With a background in UX and
                customer experience, Iâ€™m now focusing on building my technical skills and learning to create engaging,
                accessible, user-friendly web solutions.
                <br><br>
                I live in Stockholm with my partner and our dog. In my free time, I like being outdoors, knitting, or
                listening to a good audiobook while walking the dog.

                    <h3>Tech Journey</h3>
                    <p>My background in UX and CX research taught me how to understand people and their needs.
                        Now Iâ€™m building on that knowledge by learning code, so I can create the solutions
                        I once only sketched out.</p>

                <li>
                    <h3>Knitting & Creativity</h3>
                    <p>I love knitting and experimenting with patterns, and Iâ€™m part of several social knitting
                        communities. I enjoy exploring different forms of crafting, and I find a playful curiosity every
                        time I sit down to <lang="sv">"pyssla".</lang>

                    <h3>Everyday Life </h3>
                    <p>I live next to the forest and enjoy spending time outdoorsâ€”walking our dog, running on the
                        trails,
                        or simply being in nature. Iâ€™m also a certified diver, which lets me explore a very different
                        side
                        of nature.</p>
